Step 1: Pick Your Idea

Paste this into your AI tool of choice. Don’t worry about the idea you choose. It can be literally anything (crazy ideas encouraged…)

ℹ️ The {{ text in curly brackets }} are placeholders, replace them with your own information

I want you to act like a friendly but ruthless critic.
Here’s my idea: {{ insert your idea.}}
Please roast it. Tell me all the reasons it might fail, the assumptions I’m making, and what I might be blind to.
Be playful but sharp.
Didn’t get enough sting? Use the Prompt Edit trick from Part I and revise the original prompt to turn up the heat:

- “Act as an investor who’s deciding whether to fund me.”

- “Pretend you’re a competitor trying to destroy my idea.

Step 2: Flip the Script

Now ask:

Take the top 3 critiques and turn them into creative opportunities.
For each, suggest one new idea or feature that could make my concept stronger.

Step 3: Refine

Pull out a google doc, a Notion page, or whatever you use to take notes and write a short reflection: “My idea started as X. After the roast, I realized Y. Now I want to explore Z.”
